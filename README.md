# WebRecorder

WIP - will be a faster/simpler alternative for ExVCR

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add web_recorder to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:web_recorder, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure web_recorder is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:web_recorder]]
        end
